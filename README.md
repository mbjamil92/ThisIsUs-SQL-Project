# ThisIsUs-SQL-Project

This is a mini-project in which I created a whole new database in PostgreSQL, collected data from various resources like IMDB, Neilsen Media Research and Rotten Tomatoes to generate a statistical summary for a certain customer like "Hulu" or "Netflix" to make a buying decision for "This Is Us" TV show to telecast it on their own network. This analysis would be very important for them to make an informed decision.
